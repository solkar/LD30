# Space Truckin' 
## A tile-layin' game for 2, or more players 
#### *Rules version 1.0*

The universe has expanded since scientist discovered how
to tame wormholes turning them in favorite transport medium for billions 
of families in several universes. 

Trade flourishes in every corner but the competition is fierce and
building a network of wormholes is still a risky business.

Those who built the vastest network of wormholes, space stations between
planetary system will own the universe.

## Contents
* 81 space tiles, which picture planetary systems, wormholes, void and
  scientific stations.
* 10 black holes tiles.

* 20 spaceships in 2 colors
    - Each ship can be used as battleship (planetary system defense), cargo (wormhole transport), or engineers crew (scientific stations).

* Board with a 9 by 9 grid (not supplied)
 

## Overview
The players place space tiles turn by turn. As they do so, the wormholes,
planetary systems, void, and stations emerge and grow. On these, the players 
can deploy their ships to earn points. Players score points during the game 
and at the end.
The player with the most points after the final scoring is the winner.

## Preparation
Place the starting tile face up in the middle of the board. Shuffle the
remaining tiles and keep them face-down.

Each player takes 7 ships in his color and places them before her on the
table as her pool.

Place a clock with a hand for the seconds in the table where all the players 
can see it (digital clock showing seconds would work too).

The player who has participated in more editions of the Ludum Dare will
be the starting player, in case of a draw play one round of *rock, paper,
scissors*.


## Playing the game
Players take turns in clockwise order beginning with the starting
player. On a player's turn, she executes the following actions in the
order shown:
- The player **must** draw and place a new **space tile**.
- The player **may** deploy one of his **ships** from her pool to the
  space tile she just placed.
- if, by placing the space tile, **stations**, **roads**, and/or
  **planetary systems** are completed, they are now scored.
 
The player's turn is over and the next player, in clockwise order, takes
her turn in the same manner.

### Placing tiles
First player **must** draw a space tile from one of the face-down
stacks. He looks at it, shows it to his fellow players, and places it on
the table, using the following rules:

- The new tile can be placed in any free position of the board.

- If placed adjacent to another tile, the new tile must be placed so 
  that all void, planetary system, and wormhole segment on the new tile
  continue to void, planetary system, and wormhole segments, respectively, 
  on all abutting tiles (stations are always complete within single tiles).

- If the card shows, at least, one arrow in the corner you must check the
  quadrant occupied by the seconds hand in the clock, and align any of these 
  arrows in the same quadrant.

- In the circumstance where a drawn tile has no legal placement (and all
  players agree), the player discards the tile from the game and draws
  another tile to place.

#### Board edges
Opposite edges of the board are considered a continuum hence tiles in
the same row or column but on opposite edges of the board are considered
adjacent and players must take that into account placing tiles on the
edge of the board.

### Deploying ships
After the player places a space tile, she **may** deploy one of her
ships, using the following rules:
- The player may only play 1 ship on a turn.
- The player must take it from her pool.
- The player may only deploy it to the tile she just placed.
- The player must choose where to deploy the ship on the tile either as
  a :
  - battleship: in a planetary system
  - or cargo: on a wormhole segment
  - or engineer: in scientific station
- The player may not deploy a ship on a planetary system, or wormhole
  segment if that segment connects to a segment on another tile that
  already has a ship (from any player, including himself) on it. 

When a player has deployed all her ship, she continues to play space tiles 
each turn. Although a ship may not be recalled, ships are returned to players 
when stations, wormholes, and planetary systems are scored.
The playerâ€™s turn is over and the next player in clockwise order takes 
her turn, and so on.

Remember: If, through the placement of the tile, planetary systems, wormholes, 
and/or stations are completed, these are scored before moving on to the 
next player.

### Black holes
Black hole tiles are not placed in the board. Once played they are
taken from the game. The player that gets a black hole tile in her 
turn can do one of these actions:
 - Remove a cargo from an uncompleted wormhole. This cargo is lost in 
   an unknown universe and cannot be recovered. Take the ship from the,
   game it does not return to the pool of the owner.
 - Exchange the position of two tiles already placed in the board. The
   rules to place tiles must be enforced or the exchange cannot take
   place (tiles might change its orientation to facilitate this task). 
   Any ship placed on the tile remain on the original tile.

### Scoring completed stations, wormholes and planetary systems

#### Completed Wormhole
A wormhole is completed when the wormhole segments on both ends connect 
to a nexus (crossing), a planetary system segment, or a station, or when 
the wormhole forms a complete loop. There may be many wormhole segments 
between the ends.

The player who has a cargo on a completed wormhole scores **two points**
for each tile in the completed wormhole (count the number of tiles; separate 
segments on a tile count just once).

#### Completed Planetary system
A planetary system is complete when the planetary system is surrounded 
by void space with no gaps in the planetary system nor holes. A planetary 
system may have many planetary system segments. The player who has a 
battleship in a completed planetary system scores two points for each tile 
in the planetary system (count the tiles, not the segments). And adds
a ship to her pool.


*What if a completed planetary system or wormhole has more than one ship?*
It is possible through clever placement of void tiles for there to be 
more than one cargo on a road or more than one battleship in a planetary 
system. In a completed wormhole or planetary system, the player with the
most cargos (on a wormhole) or the most battleships (in a planetary system) 
earns all the points.
When two or more players tie with the most cargos or battleships, they each 
earn the total points for the wormhole or planetary system.

**Exception** Planetary systems or Wormhole formed with just 2 segments earns the
player 2 points, not 4.

#### Completed Station
A station is complete when the tile containing it is completely
surrounded by space tiles. **The player who owns the engineering crew in
the station earns 9 pts.**

##### Returning scored ships to the player's pool
**After** a wormhole, a planetary system, or a station is scored, the
ships involved are returned to the appropriate player's pool. The
returned ships may be used by the players as any of the possible ships
in the following turns.

#### Edge of the board scoring
For wormholes, planetary systems and stations that extend over the edge
of the board add 2 points to the score value.

### Game End
The game ends when the turn of the player who placed the last tile is
finished.

### Final Scoring
#### Scoring of incomplete wormholes, planetary systems, and stations
For each incomplete wormhole and planetary system, the player, who has
a ship ( cargo or battleship ) earns one point for each wormhole or
planetary system segment. For incomplete wormholes and planetary systems
with more than one ship, use the rules for completed wormholes or
planetary systems to determine who scores. 

For incomplete stations, the player with the engineer crew on the
station earns 1 point for the station and 1 point for each space tile
surrounding it.

### Wining the Game
The player who scored more points is the winner of the game.
